    <h1> Introduction </h1>
    <p>My name is Malachi Adebayo. I am currently in the second year of my Computer Science (Software Engineering) course at University of London, Goldsmiths. The primary focus of this e-portfoloio is to showcase what I have learned on the IS52062B: Network and Operating Systems (2024-25) module. I will do this by explaining key concepts and extracting relevant information from each week, whilst also providing insights into work completed on the course. This portfolio will be graded to gauge my understanding of the module.</p>
