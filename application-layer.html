    <h1>Application Layer</h1>
    <p> The Application Layer is designed to encode and decode the message in a form that can be understood by the sender and the recipent.</p>
    <h2>Network Architecture</h2>
    <p>Network Architecture defines how devices communicate, how data is transferred and how services are structured across a network.</p>
    <p>Client-Server Architecture centralises communication by a server providing services and resources. It works by a client requesting services from the server but not directly communicating with other clients. This server is always on, which means the server is continuously available to handle client requests. It also is located at a fixed IP address, making it easy for clients to connect. </p>

        <tr>
            <th> Advantages </th>
            <th> Disadvantages </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Centralised control over security and management</td>
            <td>Expensive to maintain</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Reliable performance for small to medium loads</td>
            <td>May struggle to perform under heavy traffic</td>

            <td> A single point of failure</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p> Peer-to- Peer (P2P) Architecture allows direct communication between peers. There is no central server, instead each device acts as both a client and a server. Dissimilarly to Client-Server Architecture, thiis server is not always on, allowing peers to leave and join the network dynamically.</p>

    <p> Socket Programming enables two applications to communicate over a network using TCP and UDP. A socket is an endpoint for receiving data across a network, acting as a communication gateway between applications. Sockets are identified by their IP address and port number</p>
