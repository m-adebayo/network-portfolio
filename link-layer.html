    <h1>Link Layer</h1>
    <p>The Link Layer (also known as the Network Access Layer) is responsible for transferring data physically between connected network nodes.</p>
    <p>This layer ensures proper framing and link access by encapsulating network layer data into frames for transmission. Additionally, it handles error detection and correction through methods like parity checking, Internet checksum, and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) to identify and fix errors. Flow control regulates data transfer pacing, while half and full duplex modes determine whether both nodes can transmit at the same time.</p>
    <p>TDMA and FDMA divides the channels into time slots or frequency bands respectively. Random access protocols are used to allow nodes to transmit without pre-allocated slots, detecting and handling collisions dynamically.</p>
    <p>Switches play a key role in forwarding frames based on MAC addresses, reducing collision in domains and improving network efficiency. Addressing with LANs relies on MAC addresses, which serve as device identification, and ARP, which maps IP address to MAC addresses for packet delivery.</p>

        These Python scripts demonstrate how even parity is used for error detection in transmitted data. It begins by defining a function, compute_even_parity(data), which calculates the even parity bit by summing the data bits and taking the modulo 2. If the sum is odd, the parity bit is set to 1 to make the total count of 1s even; otherwise, it is set to 0. The script then defines a list, data, representing the original binary data, and computes its parity bit. The original data and the computed parity bit are displayed. Next, the parity bit is appended to the data to form the transmitted_data, simulating how data is sent over a communication channel. To demonstrate error detection, the script introduces an artificial error by flipping a bit at a specific index in the transmitted data, creating data_with_error. At the receiver's end, a parity check is performed by summing all bits in the received data. If the sum is even, it indicates no error; otherwise, an error is detected. This simulation effectively illustrates how parity bits help in detecting single-bit errors in digital communication.
