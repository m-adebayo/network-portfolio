    <h1>Network Layer</h1>
    <p>The Network Layer (also known as the Internet Layer) is responsible for routing data packets across networks using IP addresses to identify the source and destination. The core function includes addressing, routing packetisation and fragmentaion and reassembly of the packets. IP addressing provides logical identification for devices. Routing determines the best path for data transmission, using OSPF and BGP. Packetisation involves encapsulating the segnments from the transport layer segments into IP datagrams, and fragmentation ensures the packets fit within the MTU of a network. </p>
    <p> IP addressing follows a hierachical structure, using IPv4 (32-bit). Different address classes define network sizes. Private addresses are used in local networks, and require Network Address Translation for extenal communication.</p>
    <p> DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) dynamically assigns IP addresses to hosts as they join a network. It allows devices to obtain temporary IPs. DHCP involves the process of Discover, Offer, Request and Acknowledge (DORA).</p>
    <p> NAT (Network Address Translation) enables multiple devices within a local network to share a single public IP address, enhancing security and conserving IPv4 addresses. </p>
    <p>Routing and forwarding are key network layer functions. Routing determines the best oath for data using routing tables and protocols, while forwarding involves moving packets from an input interface to the appropriate output interface. Static routing is manually configured and used mainly in small networks, whereas dynamic routing adapts to network changes.</p>

            All private IP addresses start with 10, 172 or 192, although some public IP addresses may also begin with 172 and 192.
            <br>
            Using seminar week 2, I have identified that the IP address of the university website (gold.ac.uk) is 159.100.136.66. This means that the universities IP address is public.
            <br>
            Theres 2^16 - 2 reliable hosts
            We -2 as we need to consider the broadcast and network address.
            <br>
            Engineering :
            <br>
            Starting from 172.16.0.1, you can allocate 30 hosts to the engeneering department.
            2^5 = 32
            32 - 5 = 27
            So the subnet masking would be 172.16.0.1/27
            It would be allocated 172.16.0.1 - 172.16.0.30
            <br>
            We leave 17.16.0.0 and 17.16.0.31 for the network address and broadcast address. Therefore the next department will need to start from 172.16.0.32
            <br>
            This department also needs to leave one at the start and end of its usable IP range, as it needs to reserve space for a broadcast address and a network address. Therefore the next departments usable host range will start from 172.16.0.32.
            <br>
            Marketing:
            <br>
            Starting from 172.16.0.33, you can allocate 15 hosts to the marketing department.
            <br>
            2^4 = 16
            <br>
            16-2 = 14
            <br>
            This means there is not enough usable hosts as 14 is smaller than 15.
            <br>
            2^5 = 32
            <br>
            32 - 5 = 27
            <br>
            So the subnet masking would be 172.16.0.32/27
            It would be allocated 172.16.0.32 - 172.16.0.62
            <br>
            Finance:
            <br>
            Starting from 172.16.0.65, we can allocate 10 hosts.
            <br> 
            2^4 = 16
            <br>
            16-2 =14
            <br>
            32 - 4 = 28
            <br>
            So the subnet masking would be 17.16.0.64/28
            It would be allocated 172.16.0.65 - 173.16.0.78
            <br>
            HR:
            <br>
            Starting from 172.16.0.81, we can allocate 5 hosts.
            <br>
            2^3 = 8
            <br>
            8-2 = 6
            <br>
            32-3= 29
            <br>
            So the subnet masking would be 172.16.0.80/29
            It would be allocated 172.16.0.91 - 172.16.0.86
